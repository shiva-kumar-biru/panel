# DIgSILENT POWERFACTORY WEB INTERFACE

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a web interface for visualizing Digsilent Power-Factory simulation data and a basic control system to interact with it, by an open-source Python library "PANEL".

This will streamline the simulation process, which makes it simpler to use as it bypasses the requirement to use Power-Factory directly for repeated tasks.
