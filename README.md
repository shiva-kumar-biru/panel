# DIgSILENT POWERFACTORY WEB INTERFACE

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a web interface for Digsilent Power-Factory, a software tool used for power system simulations by an open-source python library "PANEL".

This will streamline the simulation process and make it more user-friendly, as users will be able to perform simulations without needing to navigate the complex Power Factory software.
